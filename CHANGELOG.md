* **Support for styles xAxis labels**

  XAxis now supports complex data argument with `svg` property to style each label individually. See [examples repo](https://github.com/JesperLekland/react-native-svg-charts-examples) for usage.
  Thanks to @fqueiruga for this ❤️


* **Support for backgroundColor in ProgressCircle**

  You can now customize the progress "background" color

* **Support for strokeWidth in ProgressCircle**

  Customize the width of the ProgressCircle

* **Prettier transition in ProgressCircle from progress to background**

  Old implementation used to have a small cutoff between the progress and the background.
  Now the progress seems to be "inside" the circle instead.
