* **Support for horizontal StackedBarChart**

  StackedBarChart now supports the prop `horizontal`
  just as a regular BarChart


* **StackedBar/AreaChart adheres to new `extras` api**

  StackedBarChart and StackedAreaChart was still on the legacy `renderExtras`
  pattern. It has now been migrated to the single `extras` prop api.
