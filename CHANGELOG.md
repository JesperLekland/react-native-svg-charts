This release changes some fundamentals about the API but we're confident that they're all for the better. The new arguments passed to the `extras` functions opens up vast customisation options that allow us to really clean up the API. The switch to a arbitrary data structure also allows us to cater to more use cases and make sure we are future proof. 

We're super excited for you guys to try out version 3! 

We will soon try to tighten up the README and move most of the examples over to the [react-native-svg-charts-examples](https://github.com/JesperLekland/react-native-svg-charts-examples) repository. This repo will function as a showcase of all the cool uses of this library.

## Changes ( many of them *breaking* )

### XAxis & YAxis

* Axes are now rendered with `react-native-svg`'s [Text](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg#text), 
    allowing for better alignment and a more streamligned api.
* `svg` prop added to customize each `<Text>`
* `values`/`dataPoints` renamed to `data` to better reflect rest of component api (supports complex data)
* (XAxis) `xAccessor` prop added to extract correct value from `data` array
* (YAxis) `yAccessor` prop added to extract correct value from `data` array
* `scale` prop added to customize scale of axis

### `renderExtra` is removed
Seeing how `renderExtra` was almost always used to just call 
the function that was passed in as `extras` we decided to remove this step 
and simply call the `extra` entry as a function directly, passing in the same props as before

In order to allow for the above change each entry in `extras`
must now be a function that renders a component. See documentation for examples

### LineChart

* `dataPoints` is now `data`
* `data` supports complex data structures
* `xAccessor` and `yAccessor` added to support extraction of values from complex data structure
* `xScale` and `yScale` prop added to allow for custom scales
* `renderExtra` is removed - See above
* `extra` now passes `line` as an extra argument property. This is the line svg path
    and can be used to render e.g line shadows.
* no longer renders a shadow by default. Use `extras` instead
* `renderGradient` is removed and can now be rendered via `extra`. See documentation for example
* `shadowSvg` and `shadowOffset` is now removed. Render your own shadow using `renderExtra

### AreaChart
* `dataPoints` is now `data`
* `data` supports complex data structures
* `xAccessor` and `yAccessor` added to support extraction of values from complex data structure
* `xScale` and `yScale` prop added to allow for custom scales
* `renderExtra` is removed - See above
* `extra` now passes `area` and `line` as extra argument property. 
    This is the area svg path as well as the path of line that follows the area's upper bound. See docs for example usage
* `renderGradient` is removed and can now be rendered via `extra`. See documentation for example
* no longer renders "top" line, use `extras` for this (see docs for example)

### WaterfallChart
* deprecated - will be removed in future versions (due to low usage poor maintenance)
 
### `animate` default is now `false`
We figured opt-in is better than opt-out considering how poorly the animations are working at the moment

## Comments 

Due to the inherent nature of a bar chart consisting of many areas the `BarChart` component has not yet been migrated to the new APIs
