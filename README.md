Welcome to react-native-svg-charts!

### version 4 now available!
BarChart and PieChart have joined the latest API!
A few of breaking changes are introduced in this version but we've taken great care to make sure migrating is easy.
See [releases](https://github.com/JesperLekland/react-native-svg-charts/releases) for more information.

---
In order to not bloat this README to much we've moved some examples over to
[`react-native-svg-charts-examples`](https://github.com/JesperLekland/react-native-svg-charts-examples).
There we will try to showcase the really cool things you can do with this library.
This README will try to keep things as simple as possible so that everybody can get up and running as fast as possible.


## Prerequisites

This library uses [react-native-svg](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg)
to render its graphs. Therefore this library needs to be installed **AND** linked into your project to work.

Other than the above dependency this library uses pure javascript and supports both iOS and Android

## Motivation

Creating beautiful graphs in React Native shouldn't be hard or require a ton of knowledge.
We use [react-native-svg](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg) in order to render our SVG's and to provide you with great extensibility.
We utilize the very popular [d3](https://d3js.org/) library to create our SVG paths and to calculate the coordinates.

We built this library to be as extensible as possible while still providing you with the most common charts and data visualization tools out of the box.
The Line-, Bar-, Area- and Pie- charts can all be extended with "decorators" and "extras".
The `renderDecorator` prop is called on each passed `data` entry and allows you to easily add things such as points or other decorators to your charts.
The `extras` prop is used to further decorate your charts with e.g intersections, projections, gradients and much more, see the [examples repo](https://github.com/JesperLekland/react-native-svg-charts-examples) for more info.

Feedback and PR's are more than welcome ðŸ™‚

## Running

If you want to test out the library you can clone this repository and run it.
We suggest that you test out the [storybooks](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) that we've implemented.
Most of the charts are implemented with [knobs](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/addons/knobs) so that you can tweak most properties and see their behavior live.

Clone the repo and run the following:

```bash
yarn

# for iOS
(cd ios && pod install)
react-native run-ios

# for Android
react-native run-android

yarn storybook

# and then reload your device
```




## Common Props

| Property | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| data | **required** | An array of arbitrary data - use prop `xAccessor`/`yAccessor`to tell the chart about the data structure|
| yAccessor | ({ item }) => item | A function that takes each entry of `data` (named "item") as well as the index and returns the y-value of that entry |
| xAccessor | ({ index }) => index | Same as `yAccessor` but returns the x-value of that entry|
| yScale | d3Scale.scaleLinear | A function that determines the scale of said axis (only tested with scaleLinear, scaleTime & scaleBand )|
| xScale | d3Scale.scaleLinear | Same as `yScale` but for the x axis |
| svg | `{}` | an object containing  all the props that should be passed down to the underlying `react-native-svg` component. [See available props](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg#common-props)|
| animate | true | PropTypes.bool |
| animationDuration | 300 | PropTypes.number |
| style | undefined | Supports all [ViewStyleProps](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/viewstyleproptypes.html) |
| curve | d3.curveLinear | A function like [this](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#curves) |
| contentInset | { top: 0, left: 0, right: 0, bottom: 0 } | An object that specifies how much fake "margin" to use inside of the SVG canvas. This is particularly helpful on Android where `overflow: "visible"` isn't supported and might cause clipping. Note: important to have same contentInset on axis's and chart |
| numberOfTicks | 10 | We use [d3-array](https://github.com/d3/d3-array#ticks) to evenly distribute the grid and dataPoints on the yAxis. This prop specifies how many "ticks" we should try to render. Note: important that this prop is the same on both the chart and on the yAxis |
| showGrid | true | Whether or not to show the grid lines |
| gridMin | undefined | Normally the graph tries to draw from edge to edge within the view bounds. Using this prop will allow the grid to reach further than the actual dataPoints. [Example](#gridmin/max) |
| gridMax | undefined | The same as "gridMin" but will instead increase the grids maximum value |
| renderGrid | `Grid.Horizontal` | A function that returns the component to be rendered as the grid |
| extras | undefined | An array of whatever data you want to render. Each item in the array will call `renderExtra`. [See example](#extras) |
| renderDecorator | `() => {}`| Called once for each entry in `dataPoints` and expects a component. Use this prop to render e.g points (circles) on each data point. [See example](#decorator) |

### AreaChart

![Area chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesperlekland/react-native-svg-charts/master/screenshots/area-chart.png)

#### Example

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { AreaChart } from 'react-native-svg-charts'
import * as shape from 'd3-shape'

class AreaChartExample extends React.PureComponent {

    render() {

        const data = [ 50, 10, 40, 95, -4, -24, 85, 91, 35, 53, -53, 24, 50, -20, -80 ]

        return (
            <AreaChart
                style={ { height: 200 } }
                data={ data }
                contentInset={ { top: 30, bottom: 30 } }
                curve={shape.curveNatural}
                svg={{ fill: 'rgba(134, 65, 244, 0.8)' }}
            />
        )
    }
}
```

#### Props

See [Common Props](#common-props)

| Property | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| start | 0 | The value of which the area should start (will always end on the data point)  |

### StackedAreaChart

Very similar to an area chart but with multiple sets of data stacked together. Notice that the `dataPoints` prop has changed to `data` and have a different signature.
We suggest that you read up on [d3 stacks](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#stacks) in order to better understand this chart and its props
See [Area stack chart with Y axis](https://github.com/JesperLekland/react-native-svg-charts-examples/blob/master/storybook/stories/area-stack/with-y-axis.js) to see how to use a YAxis with this component

![Stacked area chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesperlekland/react-native-svg-charts/master/screenshots/area-stack.png)

#### Example

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { StackedAreaChart } from 'react-native-svg-charts'
import * as shape from 'd3-shape'

class StackedAreaExample extends React.PureComponent {

                dates: 400,
            },
        ]

        const colors = [ '#8800cc', '#aa00ff', '#cc66ff', '#eeccff' ]
        const keys   = [ 'apples', 'bananas', 'cherries', 'dates' ]

        return (
            <StackedAreaChart
                style={ { height: 200, paddingVertical: 16 } }
                data={ data }
                keys={ keys }
                colors={ colors }
                curve={ shape.curveNatural }

Also see [Common Props](#common-props)

### BarChart
![Bar chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesperlekland/react-native-svg-charts/master/screenshots/bar-chart.png)

#### Example
```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { BarChart } from 'react-native-svg-charts'

class BarChartExample extends React.PureComponent {

    render() {

        const fill = 'rgb(134, 65, 244)'
        const data    = [ 50, 10, 40, 95, -4, -24, 85, 91, 35, 53, -53, 24, 50, -20, -80 ]

        return (
            <BarChart
                style={ { height: 200 } }
                data={data}
                svg={{ fill }}
                contentInset={ { top: 30, bottom: 30 } }
                { ...this.props }
            />
        )
    }

}
```

### Props
Also see [Common Props](#common-props)

| Property | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| data | **required** |  The data prop in a barChart can look exactly like in a Line- or AreaChart, i.e an array of just numbers or complex objects. It can however also be an array with several data sets. A data object can contain a `svg` property which allows you two override styles on that specific object. See [the examples repo](https://github.com/JesperLekland/react-native-svg-charts-examples)|
| horizontal | false | Boolean whether or not the bars should be horizontal |
| svg | `{}` | Default svg props **for all bars**. Supports all svg props an svg path normally supports. This styles will be overriden if there are specific styles for a given data object  |
| spacingInner | 0.05 | Spacing between the bars (or groups of bars) |
| spacingOuter | 0.05 | Spacing outside of the bars (or groups of bars). Percentage of one bars width |
| contentInset | `{ top: 0, left: 0, right: 0, bottom: 0 }` | PropTypes.shape |

### StackedBarChart

The same as the [StackedAreaChart](#stackedareachart) except with bars.
We suggest that you read up on [d3 stacks](https://github.com/d3/d3-shape#stacks) in order to better understand this chart and its props

![Stacked bar chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesperlekland/react-native-svg-charts/master/screenshots/bar-stack.png)

                dates: 400,
                oranges: 400,
            },

                dates: 400,
            },
        ]

        const colors = [ '#7b4173', '#a55194', '#ce6dbd', '#de9ed6' ]
        const keys   = [ 'apples', 'bananas', 'cherries', 'dates' ]

        return (
            <StackedBarChart
                style={ { height: 200 } }
                keys={ keys }

### LineChart
![Line chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesperlekland/react-native-svg-charts/master/screenshots/line-chart.png)

#### Example

```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { LineChart } from 'react-native-svg-charts'

class LineChartExample extends React.PureComponent {

    render() {

        const data = [ 50, 10, 40, 95, -4, -24, 85, 91, 35, 53, -53, 24, 50, -20, -80 ]

        return (
            <LineChart
                style={ { height: 200 } }
                data={ data }
                svg={{ stroke: 'rgb(134, 65, 244)' }}
                contentInset={ { top: 20, bottom: 20 } }
            />
        )
    }

}

```

#### Props
See [Common Props](#common-props)

### PieChart

The PieChart is a really nice component with great support for custom behavior.
The PieChart does not support the `extras` prop as it doesn't make much sense in the context of a pie chart.
It does however support the decorator prop with some extra arguments to help you layout your labels (and whatnot).

See more examples in the [examples repo](https://github.com/JesperLekland/react-native-svg-charts-examples)

![Pie chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesperlekland/react-native-svg-charts/master/screenshots/pie-chart.png)

#### Example
```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { PieChart } from 'react-native-svg-charts'

class PieChartExample extends React.PureComponent {

    render() {

        const data = [ 50, 10, 40, 95, -4, -24, 85, 91, 35, 53, -53, 24, 50, -20, -80 ]

        const randomColor = () => ('#' + (Math.random() * 0xFFFFFF << 0).toString(16) + '000000').slice(0, 7)

        const pieData = data
            .filter(value => value > 0)
            .map((value, index) => ({
                value,
                svg: {
                    fill: randomColor(),
                    onPress: () => console.log('press', index),
                },
                key: `pie-${index}`,
            }))

        return (
            <PieChart
                style={ { height: 200 } }
                data={ pieData }
            />
        )
    }

}

```

#### Props

| Property | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| data | **required** | Very similar to the data prop of our other charts, the only exception is that the PieChart only accepts complex objects (not just numbers). An item can also contain the `arc` property which allows you two override settings on that specific arc. See [examples repo](https://github.com/JesperLekland/react-native-svg-charts-examples) |
| valueAccessor | ({ item }) => item.value | Very similar to the `yAccessor` of the other charts |
| outerRadius | "100%" | The outer radius, use this to tweak how close your pie is to the edge of it's container. Takes either percentages or absolute numbers (pixels) |
| innerRadius | "50%" | The inner radius, use this to create a donut. Takes either percentages or absolute numbers (pixels) |
| labelRadius | undefined | The radius of the circle that will help you layout your labels. Takes either percentages or absolute numbers (pixels) |
| padAngle | |  The angle between the slices |
| sort | `(a,b) => b.value - a.value` | Like any normal sort function it expects either 0, a positive or negative return value. The arguments are each an object from the `dataPoints` array |


### ProgressCircle
![Progress circle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesperlekland/react-native-svg-charts/master/screenshots/progress-circle.png)

#### Example
```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { ProgressCircle }  from 'react-native-svg-charts'

class ProgressCircleExample extends React.PureComponent {

    render() {

        return (
            <ProgressCircle
                style={ { height: 200 } }
                progress={ 0.7 }
                progressColor={'rgb(134, 65, 244)'}
            />
        )
    }

}

```


#### Props

| Property | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| progress | **required** | PropTypes.number.isRequired |
| progressColor | 'black' | PropTypes.any |
| backgroundColor | '#ECECEC' |  PropTypes.any |
| startAngle | `0` | PropTypes.number |
| endAngle | `Math.PI * 2` |  PropTypes.number |
| strokeWidth | 5 |  PropTypes.number |

### YAxis

![Y-axis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesperlekland/react-native-svg-charts/master/screenshots/y-axis.png)

A helper component to layout your Y-axis labels on the same coordinates as your chart.
It's very important that the component has the exact same view bounds (preferably wrapped in the same parent view) as the chart it's supposed to match.
If the chart has property `contentInset` set it's very important that the YAxis has the same vertical contentInset.

#### Example
```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { LineChart, YAxis } from 'react-native-svg-charts'
import { View } from 'react-native'

class YAxisExample extends React.PureComponent {

    render() {

        const data = [ 50, 10, 40, 95, -4, -24, 85, 91, 35, 53, -53, 24, 50, -20, -80 ]

        const contentInset = { top: 20, bottom: 20 }

        return (
            <View style={ { height: 200, flexDirection: 'row' } }>
                <YAxis
                  data={data}
                  contentInset={ contentInset }
                  svg={{
                      fill: 'grey',
                      fontSize: 10,
                  }}
                  formatLabel={ value => `${value}ÂºC` }
                />
                <LineChart
                    style={ { flex: 1, marginLeft: 16 } }
                    data={data}
                    svg={{ stroke: 'rgb(134, 65, 244)' }}
                    contentInset={ contentInset }
                />
            </View>
        )
    }

}

```

#### Props

(see [Common Props](#common-props))

| Property | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| scale | `d3Scale.scaleLinear`| Should be the same as passed into the charts `yScale`, *or* d3Scale.scaleBand if used in conjunction with a horizontal BarChart |
| svg | `{}` | supports all svg props an svg text normally supports |
| spacingInner | 0.05 | Spacing between the labels. Only applicable if `scale=d3Scale.scaleBand` and should then be equal to `spacingInner` prop on the actual BarChart |
| spacingOuter | 0.05 | Spacing outside of the labels. Only applicable if `scale=d3Scale.scaleBand` and should then be equal to `spacingOuter` prop on the actual BarChart  |
| formatLabel | `value => {}` | A utility function to format the text before it is displayed, e.g `value => "$" + value |
| contentInset | { top: 0, bottom: 0 } | Used to sync layout with chart (if same prop used there) |
| min | undefined | Used to sync layout with chart (if gridMin is used there) |
| max | undefined | Used to sync layout with chart (if gridMax is used there) |


### XAxis

![Line chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jesperlekland/react-native-svg-charts/master/screenshots/x-axis.png)

A helper component to layout your X-axis labels on the same coordinates as your chart.
It's very important that the component has the exact same view bounds (preferably wrapped in the same parent view) as the chart it's supposed to match.
If the chart has property `contentInset` set it's very important that the XAxis has the same horizontal contentInset.

The XAxis also supports the `xAccessor` prop, if it's not supplied it will assume that you're only interested in the index of the data set.

#### Example
```javascript
import React from 'react'
import { LineChart, XAxis } from 'react-native-svg-charts'
import { View } from 'react-native'

class XAxisExample extends React.PureComponent {

    render() {

        const data = [ 50, 10, 40, 95, -4, -24, 85, 91, 35, 53, -53, 24, 50, -20, -80 ]

        return (
            <View style={{ height: 200, padding: 20 }}>
                <LineChart
                    style={{ flex: 1 }}
                    data={data}
                    gridMin={0}
                    contentInset={{ top: 10, bottom: 10 }}
                    svg={{ stroke: 'rgb(134, 65, 244)' }}
                />
                <XAxis
                    style={{ marginHorizontal: -10 }}
                    data={ data }
                    formatLabel={ value => index }
                    contentInset={{ left: 10, right: 10 }}
                    svg={{ fontSize: 10 }}
                />
            </View>
        )
    }
}

```


#### Props

| Property | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| data | **required** | An array of values or objects to render on the xAxis. Should preferably have the same length as the chart's dataPoints. If a complex object is used instead of a simple value, a `xAccessor`  prop **is required** to calculate the axis' extent. A data object can contain a `svg` property which allows you to override styles on that specific object  |
| scale | `d3Scale.scaleLinear`| Should be the same as passed into the charts `xScale` |
| spacingInner | 0.05 | Spacing between the labels. Only applicable if `scale=d3Scale.scaleBand` and should then be equal to `spacingInner` prop on the actual BarChart |
| spacingOuter | 0.05 | Spacing between the labels. Only applicable if `scale=d3Scale.scaleBand` and should then be equal to `spacingOuter` prop on the actual BarChart |
| svg | `{}` | Default svg props **for all labels**. Supports all svg props an svg text normally supports. This styles will be overriden if there are specific styles for a given data object  |
| formatLabel | `value => value` | A utility function to format the text before it is displayed, e.g `value => "day" + value`. Passes back the value provided by the `xAccessor` |
| contentInset | { left: 0, right: 0 } | Used to sync layout with chart (if same prop used there) |


### Decorator

The `renderDecorator` prop allow for decorations on each of the provided data points. The `renderDecorator` is very similar to the `renderItem` of a [FlatList](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flatlist.html)
and is a function that is called with an object as an arguments to help the layout of the extra decorator. The content of the argument object is as follows:

```javascript
{
    value: number, // the value of the data points. Pass to y function to get y coordinate of data point
    index: number, // the index of the data points. Pass to x function to get x coordinate of data point
    x: function, // the function used to calculate the x coordinate of a specific data point index
    y: function, // the function used to calculate the y coordinate of a specific data point value
}
```

Remember that all components returned by `renderDecorator` must be one that is renderable by the [`<Svg/>`](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg#svg) element, i.e all components supported by [react-native-svg](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-svg)

[Examples](https://github.com/JesperLekland/react-native-svg-charts-examples)

### Extras
The `extras` prop allow for arbitrary decorators on your chart.
and is a function that is called with an object as an arguments to help the layout of the extra decorator.
This prop is what really makes this library special. With this prop you can customize your charts to your hearts content - gradients, toolTips, clips, images, anything that is supported by `react-native-svg` can be added to your chart through this prop.
See the [examples repo](https://github.com/JesperLekland/react-native-svg-charts-examples) for some really cool use cases

The content of the extras argument object is as follows:

```javascript
{
    item: any, // the entry of the 'extras' array
    x: function, // the function used to calculate the x coordinate of a specific data point index
    y: function, // the function used to calculate the y coordinate of a specific data point value
    index: number, // the index of the item in the 'extras' array
    width: number, // the width of the svg canvas,
    height: number, // the number fo the svg canvas,
}
```
There might be additional parameters sent to the `extras` functions as well, depending on the chart type.

The `LineChart` passes the svg path data that rendered the line. (argument name `line`)

The `AreaChart` passes both the area svg path as well as the
svg path for the line following the upper bounds of the area.
(argument name `area` and `line` respectively)

Take a look in the source code for additional details.
